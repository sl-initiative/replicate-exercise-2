    <h3>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe calls for sliced cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp cheddar,
        mild cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese - it tastes
        nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.
        <br>
        Other delicious options are gruyere, brie, fontina, gouda, pepper jack, and havarti.
